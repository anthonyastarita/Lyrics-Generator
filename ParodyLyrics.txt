Creeper
Aw man
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
Side-side to side
This task, a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight

Heads up
You hear a sound, turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh, no, it's you again
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes-eye-eyes

'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Stuff again-gain)
 
Just when you think you're safe
Overhear some hissing from right behind
Right-right behind
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time
Time-time-time-time

Blows up
Then your health bar drops and you could use a one-up
Get inside, don't be tardy
So, now you're stuck in there
Half a heart is left, but don't die, die, die
Die-die-die

'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
 

(Creepers, you're mine, haha)
Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
And make some armor, get it, baby
Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me, bro, huh
Training in your room under the torchlight
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
Every single day and the whole night
Creeper's out prowlin', hoo, alright
Look at me, look at you
Take my revenge, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm a warrior, baby, what else is new?
And my blade's gonna tear through you, bring it


'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
(Gather your stuff, yeah, let's take back the world)
Yeah, baby, tonight (Haha)
Grab your sword, armor and go (It's on)
Take your revenge (Woo), oh-oh, oh-oh
So fight, fight, like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, show them your bite (Woo)

'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel and bolt again (Bolt again-gain, woo)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight (Come on, swing your sword up high)
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Come on, jab your sword down low)


Diamond, hey!

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
Oh‚ here we go‚ diamonds in the snow
Oh‚ you know, to the end, oh‚ here we go

[Verse 1: ReptileLegit]
If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose
I don't mean to kill your sheep‚ now you're takin' all my crops
I'ma mine ores later on, minin' all these different blocks
I'ma craft ourselves a cake with couple cherries on the top
Fightin' zombies in the dark while we play "Cat" on the Jukebox


I thought you would mine with me
You betrayed our PVP team
So what I'm gon' do?
I'ma mine these diamonds, make a diamond base without you

Oh, here we go, diamonds in the snow
Oh, you know, to the end, oh, here we go
 
If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose

[Verse 2: Galaxy Goats]
Look! Arrow, arrow
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last Creeper did me dirty, dirty
Like a griefer on a server, server
Now my armor is some diamonds, I'm hard like the block bedrock
Can't mine no iron ores, I can only mine them diamonds
That's a fact, dressed in black, my pick breaks, craft it back
I be chillin' watchin' PewDiePie, my favorite Minecrafter
Now, you know how I get, everyday minin' diamonds
Rather ban you off my server then see you with another Alex, uh


Oh, here we go, diamonds in the snow
Oh, you know, to the end, oh, here we go

If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose
 
I thought you would mine with me
You betrayed our PVP team
So what I'm gon' do?
I'ma mine these diamonds, make a diamond base without you


I came to dig, dig, dig, dig,
I'll build a city that's so big, big, big, big,
Just wait a sec, gotta kill this pig, pig, pig, pig,
Cook me some bacon, take a swig, swig, swig, swig,

Yeah, yeah,
There must be something, I, can craft,
To ease the bur-den of, this task, yeah,

I shoot my arrows in the air, some-times,
Sayin' ay-oh, creepers K-O'd,
Loot his remains and now his sulfur's, mine,
Sayin' ay-oh, not today-no,

And then I go to work,
Under the birch tree,
And I'll make myself,
Tons of TNT,

And I'll use these blocks, to build a big ci-ty,
And I'll mine it all, with my TNT,

I came to blow, blow, blow, blow,
Up everything you've ever known, known, known, known,
Expel you out of house and home, home, home, home,
Biome to biome, you shall roam, roam, roam, roam,
Yeah, yeah,

'Cause I'm a creeper, I will rob,
All of your items, that's my job, yeah,

I shoot my arrows in the air, some-times,
Sayin' ay-oh, creepers K-O'd,
T-bag his ghost and now his sulfurs, mine,
Sayin' ay-oh, MLG, pro,

And then I'll head back home,
Where I'll smile with glee,
Now that I can make,
Tons of TNT,

'Cause I rule my world,
Made in 3 by 3,
I'ma blow stuff up,
With my TNT,

I'm gonna' blow it all, up,
Every mountain, every valley,
Ruler of the world, yo,
All of the animals, will fear me,
'Cause TNT, is awesome,
And TNT, is just really cool,
It's just really cool,
It's just really cool,

I'm gonna shoot my arrows in the air,
arrows in the air,
shoot your arrows in the air, air, air,

I shoot my arrows in the air, some-times,
Sayin' ay-oh, creepers k-o'd,
Teabag his ghost and now his sulfurs, mine,
Sayin' ay-oh, MLG, pro,

And then I'll head back home,
Where I'll smile with glee,
Now that I can make,
Tons of TNT,

'Cause I rule my world,
Made in 3 by 3,
I'ma blow stuff up,
With my TNT.

Got my helmet on my head
Figure out what that zombie said (wut)
Lava all over the room
Gotta' half heart left, man, I am doomed

Don't have any iron bars
Pick just broke into some shards
Scary noise what should I do
Go left or right I'll have to choose

Visions of last time, flash inside my mind
I'm scared, OH WELL
And I'm pretty sure, there's a big creeper
Right there!)

(Don't mine at night)
I know your lookin' at that cave
And your feelin' kinda' brave.
Go to bed you'll be alright

(Don't mine at night)
There's nothing that is gonna' change
If you just wait until the day
Zombie wanna' eat your brains

(Don't mine at night)
I know it's me your gonna' thank
Make a bed it's not too late
3 wool and 3 wooden planks

(Don't mine at night)
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a
Woah

Don't mine at night
(don't mine at night)
Don't mine at night
(don't mine at night)

Stomach's all tied up in knots
This labyrinth, I'm gettin' lost
This is really gettin' old
Found like 2 pieces of coal

Down one way there's just stone
Monsters won't leave me alone
Down another there's some lava
And of course I get, PWND

Remember last time I tried to mine at night
I failed, so bad

I lost all my stuff
It was really tough
That's it (RAGE QUIT!)

(Don't mine at night)
I know your lookin' at that cave
And your feelin' kinda' brave.
Go to bed you'll be alright

(Don't mine at night)
There's nothing that is gonna' change
If you just wait until the day
Zombie wanna' eat your brains

(Don't mine at night)

I came to dig
I'll build a city oh so big
Just wait a sec, gotta kill this pig
Cook me some bacon, take a swig, swig, swig

Because there must be something I can craft
To help me ease the burden of this task

I shoot my arrows in the sky, they flyin'
Saying ooooooooh,
Creeper's KO'd
Loot his remains and now his sulphur's mine
Saying oooooooooh,
Not today, no

Then I'll go to work under the birch tree
And I'll make myself tons of TNT
And I'll use it all to build a city
I'll mine it all
With TNT

I came to blow
Up everything you've ever known
Expel you out of house and home
Biome to biome you shall roam, roam, roam

Because I am a creeper, I will rob
All of your precious items, that's my job

I shoot my arrows in the sky, they flyin'
Saying oooooooh,
Creeper's KO'd
Teabag his ghost and now his sulphur's mine
Sayin' oooooooh,
Not today, no
Then I'll get back home where I'll smile with glee
Now that I can make tons of TNT
'Cause I rule my world, made in three by three
I'll blow it up
With TNT

Gonna blow it all up
Every mountain, every valley
Blowing up the world, yeah
All the animals will fear me
'Cause TNT's just
TNT's just really cool
It's just really cool, it's just really cool

I shoot my arrows in the sky, they flyin'
They flyin'

I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land
It was the creepers and Skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know that Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know that Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

I’m mining I’m mining I’m mining I’m mining
[Chorus] Mob so icy wonder why they kill me, I’m just mining In water, I just fell in a hole, now I’m crying Ever server I go on (yea) it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining I just bought an account and now I’m playing Diamond sword so heavy I feel like I’m holding a mountain Every server (yea) I go on, it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining
[Verse 1] I’m with all my friends (yea), we mining, not alone Spawning all these creepers (yea), making them some clones Found a nearby dog, feed him a bone Tryna find Ores, full 64 stacks of cobblestone Pick up the arrows, put in the bow, make the string stretch Climbing all these mountains I feel off the edge Download some mods so on Minecraft I am can flex Get that texture pack, the hard working project Went in creative mode, now I’m flying Blowing stuff up with TNT, now that’s satisfying New server with scary mobs, horrifying She looked in my chest and she looked at a hundred diamonds
[Chorus] Mob so icy wonder why the kill me, I’m just mining In water, I just fell in a hole, now I’m crying Ever server I go on (yea) it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining I just bought an account and now I’m playing Diamond sword so heavy I feel like I’m holding a mountain Every server (yea) I go on, it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining
[Verse 2] Mincraft, hands down, is my favorite game Talk crap, bout using a bow, don’t know how to aim When you get slam remember my name When I expose you it’s gonna be a bloody shame Tried to go the nether but had no portal Dare you to try to kill me (Ha!), Gorsh I’m immortal Minecraft equals cube, don’t mess with circles BullVay(?) run the game, have the fun, i’m universal Favorite block in minecraft has to be a piston Every survival game I play I’m always winning Start a brand new world with a new beginning Talking crap but can’t make bars, Minecraft spitting
[Chorus] Mob so icy wonder why the kill me, I’m just mining In water, I just fell in a hole, now I’m crying Ever server I go on (yea) it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining I just bought an account and now I’m playing Diamond sword so heavy I feel like I’m holding a mountain Every server (yea) I go on, it’s inspiring Minecraft (x5) I’m just mining
[Outro] I’m mining I’m mining I’m mining I’m mining

Minin' away
I don't know what to mine for
I'll mine this anyway
In this Minecraft day
So beautiful, mine further down
What's that I found?

Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!

So easy to mine
With my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels
Hopefully they stay
In my Minecraft chests
So I'm gonna make
A lock on it

Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine DIAMONDS! (Take on me)
I'll mine them!
So far I've got two!
 

"Ah! *cough*, *cough*, *cough*, *cough*, *sniff*, *cough*
I'm alright, I'm ready"

All these diamonds
Sittin' carefully lay
I'm getting worried ("Shut the f*cking door!")
If they might get stolen
From my ender chest
Wait, who is that?
Holy sheep, it's Notch!

Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Now they're safe
Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Now...
Now that they're safe
Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Mine diamonds, *HEAVY breathin* (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)

"Uh, Thanks, thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song"
